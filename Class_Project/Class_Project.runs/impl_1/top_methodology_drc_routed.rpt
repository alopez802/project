2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-14#1 Critical Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT GEN_VGA/VGA_DRIVER/hsync_i_2 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -81.756 ns between GEN_TOP_CONV/data_reg[0]_replica/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and GEN_VGA/INIT/R_reg/D (clocked by clk25_clk_wiz_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on top_SS_rst relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on top_rst relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
